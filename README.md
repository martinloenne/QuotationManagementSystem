# Quotation Managament System

This project focuses on creating a tool to assist
the company X in the production of
quotations for circuit breaker panels. 

The company X already has such a system but the
system possesses significant shortcomings in its
functionalities. Through a correspondence with
X and an extensive analysis of the problem
and application domain, the system requirements
are decided, both in regards to improvements
on the existing system as well as additional
functionalities for the new system. 

One of the major focus points during the project is
the analysis and design of the system. 

The project was produced using an iterative process, and the
program was developed using the structural design
pattern MVVM. 

The program includes an administrative tool for generating quotations as
well as a database for structuring and maintaining
the components involved in creating a circuit
breaker panel.
